        <p class="intro">
          At Carbonify, we believe that sustainability should be
          <strong>accessible, actionable, and impactful</strong>‚Äînot just for big
          corporations, but for every business in the Philippines. As a
          <strong>localized carbon credits marketplace</strong>, Carbonify was born
          out of the urgent need to simplify the process of creating, verifying,
          and trading high-quality carbon credits within the country.
        </p>

        <p class="emissions">
          With over <strong>124.8 million metric tons of CO‚ÇÇ</strong> emitted
          annually and less than 5% of businesses participating in carbon offset
          programs, the gap between environmental awareness and climate action is
          clear. We aim to close that gap‚Äî<strong>for the planet, for the people,
          and for profit</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">üí° What We Do</h2>
        <p class="text">
          At Carbonify, we help businesses and individuals actively participate in the carbon economy.
          We provide a platform to buy and sell carbon credits, enabling users to support verified local
          sustainability projects while aligning with national and global environmental goals.

        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">üåç Our Mission</h2>
        <p class="text">
          To democratize access to carbon markets, enabling <strong>2,000+ businesses</strong>
          across energy, manufacturing, and transportation sectors to seamlessly engage in climate
          action‚Äîwithout the complexity of global platforms.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">üöÄ Our Competitive Edge</h2>
        <p class="text">
          What sets Carbonify apart is our deep commitment to local relevance, transparency,
          and user empowerment. Unlike generic platforms, we are designed specifically for the
          Philippine context, ensuring that carbon credit generation and verification are accessible
          to local businesses and communities. Our platform simplifies the entire carbon offset journey‚Äîfrom
          project registration to credit trading‚Äîwhile ensuring full traceability and compliance.
