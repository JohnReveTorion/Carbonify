      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        Recognizing the urgent need for effective climate action in the Philippines, Carbonify was founded to address the significant gap in the local carbon market. Despite the Philippines' vulnerability to environmental challenges and its increasing carbon emissions (124.8 million metric tons of COâ‚‚ annually as of 2023), participation in carbon offset programs remains low due to complexity and inaccessibility.

Carbonify is a pioneering and localized carbon credits marketplace designed to simplify and democratize access to carbon offsetting. We facilitate the creation, verification, and trading of high-quality carbon credits, empowering businesses of all sizes to contribute to a greener future, one credit at a time.
